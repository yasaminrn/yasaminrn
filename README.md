- 👋 Hi, I’m @yasaminrn
- 👀 I’m interested in applying machine learning models to solve engineering problems.
- 🌱 My projects started from my personal interests and domain expertiese. 
      They range from clustring and recommendation system for fragrances -which is an area I am highly passionate about- 
      and application of natural language processing for sentiment  analysis around popular stocks 
      to applying deep learning  to solve structural engineering problems.
      My lastest project is creating a mock interview platform which gets response of users to interview questions in speech format, converts them to text and then provides feedback to responses using OpenAI API.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in developing machine learning pipelines and providing data-driven decision making tools.
- 📫 reach me out at same username at  gmail.
