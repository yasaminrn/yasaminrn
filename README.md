- 👋 Hi, I’m @yasaminrn
- 👀 I’m interested in statistics, data science and machine learning.
- 🌱 My projects started from my personal interests and domain expertiese. 
      They range from exploratory data analysis, clustring and recommendation system for fragrances -which is an area I am highly passionate about- 
      and application of natural language processing for sentiment  analysis around popular stocks 
      to using deep learning  to solve structural engineering problems.
      My lastest project was emotional analysis of tweets of popular tech stocks for short term investment decision making.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on application of machine learning techniques to solve real world problems.
- 📫 reach me out at same username at  gmail.
